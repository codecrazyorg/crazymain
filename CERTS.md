# IT Certifications

## Introduction
* This document shows **all** the certifications you should consider obtaining for *any IT career*.
* These exams will prepare you with the **fundamental breadth** required to get your first job.
* These exams are **musts** according to multiple industry experts (working front- and backend software and hardware engineers) and my own experience as an IT recruiter.
* You can spin off and pursue your specific interests and career trajectories *only after you have mastered these basics* in order to be **immediately employable**.

## START HERE: CompTIA
* **Absolutely required**: CompTIA certs are *universally required*. **Every** IT professional **must** achieve the **A+** level *before* starting their careers.
* It's just *assumed* that you will have *at least* the CompTIA A+ certification; without it, IT recruiters *will not even look at your resume*
* These CompTIA exams are presented **in order**: you must pass each one before moving on to the next level.

### Structure & Organization of CompTIA Certs
CompTIA organizes their certs as follows: 
* Core, Infrastructure
* Cybersecurity
* Additional Professional: This is where you get the **mandatory** Cloud Essentials+ cert.

#### Core

##### CompTIA ITF+
* This is the *foundational course* of your future in IT from programming (game, bare metal, front-end, web dev), network engineering, cybersecurity (basically everything).
* You can register directly through [CompTIA's store](https://store.comptia.org/) which offers bundles and discounts or through [PearsonVUE's CompTIA Portal](https://home.pearsonvue.com/comptia).
