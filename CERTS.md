## START HERE: CompTIA

* **Absolutely required**: CompTIA certs are *universally required*. **Every** IT professional **must** achieve the **A+** level *before* starting their careers.
* It's just *assumed* that you will have *at least* the CompTIA A+ certification; without it, IT recruiters *will not even look at your resume*
* These CompTIA exams are presented **in order**: you must pass each one before moving on to the next level.

### Structure & Organization of CompTIA Certs

CompTIA organizes their certs as follows: 

* Core
* Infrastructure
* Cybersecurity
* Additional Professional: This is where you get the **mandatory** Cloud Essentials+ cert.

#### Core

##### CompTIA ITF+

## DATABASES: ORACLE & SQL

* This is a separate category from Programming & Software development because Oracle has an entire suite of certs.
* Oracle is a **massive** company as big and as important as Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, or any of the other [FAAMG](https://vested.co.in/blog/what-is-fang-or-is-it-faang-or-faamg/) companies, so Oracle is *not merely* about SQL.
* SQL (**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage) [is a programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL); however, it is not a *general purpose* language; rather, it's use is *domain-specific* to relational databases. Specifically, SQL is a *query* language. [Read this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/database-languages) to learn the distinction between all the various types of database languages to learn where SQL fits into the mix and why it is *so important*. See [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS) for more info on **r**elational **d**atabase **m**anagement **s**ystems.
* While there are *many* databases out there ([see here to learn about them](https://www.matillion.com/resources/blog/the-types-of-databases-with-examples)) **SQL lies at the core** of *everything* database-related so you *must learn it first*.
